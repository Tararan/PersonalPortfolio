                    Big thank you to Sanjeev Yadav for giving me skeleton of stackable windows animation. <br>
                    When I got stuck, I looked at his code <a
                        href="https://medium.com/@sanjeevy133/card-stack-scroll-effect-486cc3b55312.">here</a> <br>
                    <br>
                    I modernized the code and rewrote it a bit to be dynamic. <br>
                    I will share my findings in a blog post later when I collect my thoughts. <br>
                    <br>
